**There are three main ways to withdraw USDT or any cryptocurrency:**
1. Direct withdrawal from an exchange to your card.
2. Using a peer-to-peer (P2P) service on an exchange.
3. Crypto-exchanges.

Let’s break down and compare these methods. First, ask yourself if you really want to withdraw USDT to your bank account. You can transfer USDT between countries without limits, use it to buy digital goods or other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin, and even send it to friends within HERE to get cashback.

### Registration and funding on centralized exchanges

An exchange is a place where you can buy/sell cryptocurrencies and do other things like trading. It’s better to use big, trusted exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, OKX, Bybit, HTX, and others. But remember, it’s safer to keep your money in your own wallets like HERE wallet to avoid the risk of losing it due to exchange hacks or scams.

To work with any exchanges, you need to take these simple steps:

1. Sign up on the website or in the app.
2. Go through KYC verification (just like you do with a bank, but online; usually takes less than 5 minutes for approval).

Also here’s a brief guide on how to deposit to the exchange from your crypto wallet:
- Find the ‘Deposit’ button.
- Choose how you want to add cryptocurrency to the network.
- Next, select the token you want to send to the exchange.
- Make sure to choose the correct network, otherwise, you might lose your tokens.

If you’re a beginner and worried about making mistakes or don’t want to press lots of buttons each time, you can link your Binance account to HERE wallet and transfer your tokens using the ‘move’ button.

### Withdrawal using centralized exchanges

To withdraw to a card, ensure that your USDT is in the Funding account (we’ll demonstrate further steps using Binance as an example, and some steps might slightly differ on other exchanges).

**Method №1. Send to a Card**

- Then link your card and follow the exchange’s instructions

However, if direct withdrawal isn’t available in your country or you’re not satisfied with the exchange rate for direct card withdrawal, you can go to the P2P section. There, regular people act as buyers and sellers, transferring money through simple bank transfers. This method takes longer than direct card withdrawal but is equally popular. In this exchange, the platform acts as a guarantee, so don’t transfer cryptocurrency until you’ve received money in your card.

**Method №2. P2P**

- Pick P2P.
- Choose the currency you want to receive on our card.
- Click ‘Sell’ (this is where you sell to those who’ve requested to buy).
- Then, select the person to whom you’ll sell the cryptocurrency.

It’s important to consider more than just a better rate, factors like the presence of a checkmark, successful transactions, a good track record (above 90%), a suitable bank, and withdrawal limits.

### Using Crypto-Exchanges

Another popular method is using crypto exchanges (this is for more advanced users).

The user goes through a similar process, provides their card details, then sends coins to the specified address and waits for funds from the exchange.

There are special aggregators (like [link](https://www.bestchange.com) that assist users in finding exchanges. On these platforms, users can filter services by withdrawal methods, prices, client reviews, and other criteria.

It’s important to remember that there’s always a risk of encountering scammers. It could be a phishing website mimicking a real platform or an exchange set up initially for deceit. That’s why this method is more suitable for advanced users.

### Other Alternative Ways:

- Telegram chats.
- Telegram bots.
- P2P with face-to-face seller meetings.
- Cryptocurrency ATMs.

However, these methods aren’t recommended due to a high risk of scams

### Conclusion

At first, withdrawing to your bank card might seem complex, but after the first successful transaction, setup won’t take more than 10–15 minutes. Using an exchange is the most popular and secure way, and the exchange’s support can help with any questions.

This is just an overview, and before making any cryptocurrency withdrawals, it’s wise to do further research and understand the rules and potential risks involved.
